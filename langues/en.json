Ever since I was little I've been fascinated by everything to do with digital technology, whether it's computers, video games or websites. Before doing this BTS, I tried a few other things: I did a year in a preparatory course at an engineering school, then a preparatory course at HEC business school. I then took a year off to go to Japan for a year, an experience that gave me a lot of maturity. I'm fluent in French (obviously) and English, and I also speak Japanese and Spanish well.",
